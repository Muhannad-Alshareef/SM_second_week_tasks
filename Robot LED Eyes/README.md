The LED design can range from very simple to beautifully complex,  
for example, the LEDs could vary in brightness or blink depending on the robot actions,  
but since not enough information is given on the robot, this is a simple 2 LED design,

since the color is not known, they are wired in parallel, because the blue led has a forward voltage of more than 3V, which cant run in series from a 5V supply.
